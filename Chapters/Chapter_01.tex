\section{Background}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The global real estate market shows positive growth trends despite various challenges.
Real estate market remains a key sector for people like homebuyers and investors,
influenced by complex characteristics with heterogeneous nature and affected by numerous elements like policies and consumer trends.
The market is projected to grow from \$4,143.71 billion in 2024 to \$4,466.58 billion in 2025, and global real estate investment volumes continue to increase in 2024\cite{JLL2025}.

Thailand's real estate market faces both challenges and opportunities in the current economic climate. The real estate market in Thailand,
especially in Bangkok in 2024-2025, faces challenges such as high household debt, strict credit conditions, and rising costs causing market contraction,
decreasing project launches by 43.72\% in 2024\cite{nationthailand1}. However, it also presents opportunities for recovery through foreign investment driven by tourism recovery,
government incentives, and technological advancements. Condominiums remain attractive for rental yields and foreign buyers, while the housing market has moderate growth supported by infrastructure development.

% Additionally, Thailand's real estate information ecosystem suffers from several structural limitations,
% including outdated listings, lack of official transaction data, and data
% fragmentation\cite{bangkokpost1}. Addressing these issues is important for improving Thailand's
% market accessibility and decision-making for both homebuyers and investors.

Crucially, these market opportunities can significantly undermined by Thailand's real estate information ecosystem, which suffers from several structural limitations, including outdated listings,
lack of official transaction data, and data fragmentation\cite{bangkokpost1}. Addressing these issues is essential for maximizing Thailand's market potential and enabling effective decision-making
for both homebuyers and investors seeking to capitalize on the available opportunities.

\section{Problem Statement}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

Even with large amounts of real estate data available through various channels including
property listings, historical transaction records, and news, investors still
face challenges in aggregating, contextualizing, and deriving action from these
sources. Additionally, the Thai real estate market has different characteristics
from other countries because of the limited availability of official property
transaction records, listing duplication across platforms, and less standardized
data compared to more mature markets.

Current platforms in Thailand like DDProperty, Hipflat, and Baania lack many
important contextual factors such as climate risk assessments, neighborhood-specific
news, and local beliefs that influence property valuation and real estate
investment in the long term.

While platforms like Zillow and House Canary have advanced and comprehensive
real estate analytics, predictive analytics, and user-friendly interfaces, they do
not operate in Thailand. Even if these advanced platforms were to enter the Thai
market, they would face challenges adapting their algorithms to the local context.
Their models are calibrated to markets with standardized property
classifications, valuations that vary by developers, and consistent transaction
dataâ€”elements that are limited in Thailand's real estate ecosystem.

The BorBann platform addresses these challenges and aims to help users by
creating a real estate data platform integrated with artificial intelligence, geospatial
analytics, and data aggregation by focusing on analytics rather than transaction
facilitation.
